When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your##
work local?

    When you'd like to keep a backup of your files elsewhere, or even share it 
    with others.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

    Clones are like straight-out copies from a repository, be it either from a 
    local or a remote one. 
    
    Branches are a different version of an existing repository, allowing you to
    freely modify it without affecting its parent.

    Forks are basically clones from someone else's repository, keeping a
    reference to the original repository.

    You would choose to clone a repository to work on it from another
    workstation; choosing a branch would fit experimental changes without
    affecting an original repository and, finally, fork to clone and keep a
    copy of someone else's repository to work on it (if you don't have access
    to it).
