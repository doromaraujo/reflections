When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your##
work local?

    When you'd like to keep a backup of your files elsewhere, or even share it 
    with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you're the one that should know whether your local repository is
    either ready or if it is necessary to be updated with the remote's content.
    You may not want to have your local files overwritten / wrongly merged, for
    instance.
