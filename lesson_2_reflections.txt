What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    
    It creates all medatada that Git needs in order to maintain it as a 
    repository. It's necessary because you need to signal Git that it should
    keep the directory as a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    It is a cached, mirrored version of both the repository and the working
    directory. It offers a way to separate file changes into logical commits,
    rather than committing all changed files at once.
